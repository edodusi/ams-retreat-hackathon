# Context-Aware Refinement - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Implemented

The Storyblok Voice Assistant now maintains conversation context, enabling natural follow-up questions that filter previous search results.

## 🎯 Your Example Working

### Conversation Flow

**Turn 1:**
```
User: "find 10 marketing stories"
System: Returns 10 marketing stories
       Stores these in session context
```

**Turn 2:**
```
User: "out of those stories, give me the one which mentions omnichannel"
System: Filters the 10 stories for "omnichannel"
       Returns only matching stories
       Updates context with filtered results
```

**Result:** ✅ Works exactly as requested!

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Action Detection
Claude AI now recognizes two types of actions:
- **"search"**: New search query → Calls Storyblok API
- **"refine"**: Filter previous results → Filters in-memory cache

### 2. Session Context
```python
# Backend stores results per conversation
conversation_contexts = {
    "session_abc123": [
        {"name": "Story 1", "body": "content...", ...},
        {"name": "Story 2", "body": "content...", ...},
        # ... all previous search results
    ]
}
```

### 3. Filtering
When user asks "which mention omnichannel":
1. Extracts filter term: "omnichannel"
2. Searches in story name, body, and slug
3. Returns matching stories only
4. Updates context with filtered subset

## 🚀 Quick Test

```bash
# Start backend
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Open http://localhost:8000/frontend/index.html

# Try exactly your example:
1. Type: "find 10 marketing stories"
2. Wait for results
3. Type: "out of those stories, give me the one which mentions omnichannel"
4. See filtered results!
```

## 📊 Backend Logs to Watch

### Turn 1 (Search):
```
INFO: Claude response - Action: search, Term: marketing, Limit: 10
INFO: >>> PERFORMING SEARCH with term: 'marketing', limit: 10
INFO: >>> Stored 10 stories in session context for refinement
```

### Turn 2 (Refine):
```
INFO: >>> Found 10 previous results in session context
INFO: Claude response - Action: refine, Filter: omnichannel
INFO: >>> REFINING PREVIOUS RESULTS with filter: 'omnichannel'
INFO: >>> Filtered from 10 to 1 stories
```

## 🎉 Supported Patterns

### Refinement Keywords
- "out of those/these"
- "from these/those"
- "which one(s)"
- "filter by"
- "only the ones"
- "that mention"

### Examples
✅ "out of those stories, give me the one which mentions omnichannel"
✅ "from these, show me only the ones about AI"
✅ "which ones mention social media?"
✅ "filter by author"
✅ "only the recent ones"

## 🔄 Multiple Refinements

You can refine multiple times:
```
1. "find blog posts" → 10 results
2. "which mention AI" → 3 results
3. "from those, show the one about machine learning" → 1 result
```

Each refinement filters the previous results, not the original set.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Production Considerations
Current implementation uses **in-memory storage** (simple Python dict).

For production, use Redis:
```python
import redis
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
redis_client.setex(f"session:{key}", 3600, json.dumps(results))
```

### Session Key
Generated from recent conversation history hash. This means:
- Same conversation = same session
- Different conversations = different sessions
- Session persists as long as conversation continues

## 📚 Documentation

- **Complete Guide**: `docs/context-aware-refinement.md` (510 lines)
- **Quick Test**: `docs/test-context-aware.md` (281 lines)
- **Changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` (updated)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No previous results available"
**Cause:** Session context not found
**Fix:** Ensure conversation_history is sent in API requests

### Issue: 0 results after refinement
**Cause:** Filter term doesn't match any stories
**Fix:** Try broader keywords like "marketing", "social", "content"

### Issue: Always searches instead of refining
**Cause:** Claude not detecting refinement intent
**Fix:** Use clear refinement keywords: "out of those", "from these"

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Test it now** with your exact example
2. **Check logs** to see actions detected correctly
3. **Try variations** with different keywords
4. **Consider Redis** for production deployment
