# Context-Aware Refinement Feature

## Overview
The Storyblok Voice Assistant now maintains conversation context, allowing users to ask follow-up questions that reference and filter previous search results. This enables natural, iterative content discovery through multi-turn conversations.

## Feature Description

### Problem
Previously, each query was treated independently. If a user searched for "10 marketing stories" and then asked "which ones mention omnichannel?", the system would perform a new search instead of filtering the existing results.

### Solution
The system now:
1. **Remembers previous search results** in session context
2. **Detects refinement queries** (e.g., "out of those", "from these")
3. **Filters existing results** instead of performing new searches
4. **Maintains conversation state** across multiple turns

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Filter by Keyword

**Turn 1 - Initial Search:**
```
User: "Find 10 marketing stories"
System: Returns 10 marketing stories
→ Stores these 10 stories in session context
```

**Turn 2 - Refinement:**
```
User: "Out of those stories, give me the one which mentions omnichannel"
System: Filters the 10 stories for "omnichannel"
→ Returns only the matching story/stories
→ Updates context with filtered results
```

**Result:** User gets exactly what they asked for without a new search.

---

### Example 2: Multiple Refinements

**Turn 1:**
```
User: "Find blog posts about technology"
System: Returns 10 technology blog posts
```

**Turn 2:**
```
User: "From these, show me only the ones about AI"
System: Filters for "AI" keyword
→ Returns 3 posts about AI
```

**Turn 3:**
```
User: "Which one mentions machine learning?"
System: Filters the 3 AI posts for "machine learning"
→ Returns 1 post
```

**Result:** Progressive refinement through natural conversation.

---

### Example 3: New Search vs Refinement

**Turn 1:**
```
User: "Find marketing articles"
System: Returns 10 marketing articles
```

**Turn 2 - Refinement (uses previous results):**
```
User: "Show me the ones about social media"
System: Filters existing 10 articles
→ Returns subset mentioning "social media"
```

**Turn 3 - New Search (different topic):**
```
User: "Now find blog posts about design"
System: NEW SEARCH - different topic
→ Returns fresh design blog posts
→ Replaces context with new results
```

**Result:** System distinguishes between refinement and new searches.

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
Claude AI analyzes query + conversation history + previous results context
    ↓
Determines action: "search" or "refine"
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Action: search  │ Action: refine  │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Query Storyblok │ Filter cached   │
│ API             │ results         │
│                 │                 │
│ Store results   │ Update context  │
│ in context      │ with filtered   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
    ↓
Return results to user
```

### Action Detection

**Claude determines "refine" when:**
- User references previous results: "out of those", "from these", "which one"
- User wants to filter/narrow: "only the ones", "just show", "that mention"
- Context indicates working with existing results

**Claude determines "search" when:**
- User asks for new/different content
- No reference to previous results
- Completely new topic or search term

### Session Context

**What's Stored:**
```json
{
  "session_key_hash": [
    {
      "body": "Story content...",
      "cursor": 0,
      "name": "Marketing Strategy 2025",
      "slug": "blog/marketing-strategy",
      "story_id": 12345,
      "full_story": {...}
    },
    // ... more stories
  ]
}
```

**Session Key Generation:**
- Based on recent conversation history hash
- Simple in-memory storage (for production, use Redis)
- Automatically managed per conversation thread

### Filtering Logic

When action is "refine":
1. Extract `filter_term` from user query
2. Search in story fields: `name`, `body`, `slug`
3. Case-insensitive matching
4. Return all stories containing the filter term
5. Update session context with filtered subset

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Bedrock Client (`backend/bedrock_client.py`)

**Enhanced System Prompt:**
```python
"""
## Action Types

### 1. NEW SEARCH (action: "search")
When user asks for NEW content
→ {"action": "search", "term": "...", "limit": 10, "response": "..."}

### 2. REFINE/FILTER (action: "refine")
When user wants to filter previous results
→ {"action": "refine", "filter_term": "...", "response": "..."}

### 3. CHAT (action: "chat")
For general conversation
→ {"action": "chat", "response": "..."}
"""
```

**Context Injection:**
```python
def converse(message, conversation_history, previous_results=None):
    if previous_results:
        # Add context about previous results
        results_summary = f"[CONTEXT: Previous search returned {len(previous_results)} stories. "
        results_summary += "Story titles: " + ", ".join([r['name'] for r in previous_results])
        context_message = message + results_summary
```

### 2. Main API (`backend/main.py`)

**Session Management:**
```python
# In-memory storage (use Redis in production)
conversation_contexts: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]] = {}

# Generate session key
session_key = str(hash(str([msg.content for msg in conversation_history[-3:]])))

# Retrieve previous results
previous_results = conversation_contexts.get(session_key, [])
```

**Action Handling:**
```python
if action == "search":
    # Perform new search
    results = await storyblok_client.search(term=search_term, limit=limit)
    # Store in context
    conversation_contexts[session_key] = [story.dict() for story in results.stories]

elif action == "refine":
    # Filter previous results
    filtered = [s for s in previous_results if filter_term.lower() in f"{s['name']} {s['body']}".lower()]
    # Update context
    conversation_contexts[session_key] = filtered
```

## Examples with Logs

### Example: Refinement Flow

**Turn 1 - Search:**
```
User: "find 10 marketing stories"

Backend Log:
INFO: Claude response - Action: search, Term: marketing, Limit: 10
INFO: >>> PERFORMING SEARCH with term: 'marketing', limit: 10
INFO: >>> SEARCH RETURNED 10 stories (total: 10)
INFO: >>> Stored 10 stories in session context for refinement

Response: 10 story cards displayed
```

**Turn 2 - Refinement:**
```
User: "out of those stories, give me the one which mentions omnichannel"

Backend Log:
INFO: >>> Found 10 previous results in session context
INFO: Claude response - Action: refine, Filter: omnichannel
INFO: >>> REFINING PREVIOUS RESULTS with filter: 'omnichannel'
INFO: >>> Filtered from 10 to 1 stories
INFO: >>> REFINEMENT SUCCESSFUL: Returning 1 filtered stories

Response: 1 story card displayed (the one mentioning "omnichannel")
```

## Supported Refinement Patterns

| User Intent | Example Query | Action | Behavior |
|------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Filter by keyword | "which ones mention X" | refine | Search for X in stories |
| Filter by topic | "from these, show only about Y" | refine | Filter for Y topic |
| Narrow down | "out of those, give me the first 3" | refine | Limit to 3 results |
| Attribute filter | "which are published this year" | refine | Filter by date (if available) |
| New search | "now find articles about Z" | search | New search, replace context |

---

## Configuration

### Session Storage

**Current (Development):**
```python
# In-memory dictionary
conversation_contexts: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]] = {}
```

**Production Recommendation:**
```python
# Use Redis for distributed storage
import redis
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Store with TTL
redis_client.setex(f"session:{session_key}", 3600, json.dumps(results))
```

### Session Timeout
```python
# Clear old sessions (implement cleanup job)
def cleanup_old_sessions():
    # Remove sessions older than 1 hour
    pass
```

---

## Testing

### Manual Test: Basic Refinement

**Setup:**
```bash
# Start backend
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Open frontend
open http://localhost:8000/frontend/index.html
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Type: "Find 10 marketing stories"
   - Verify: 10 story cards appear
   - Check console: Session context stored

2. Type: "Out of those, give me the ones about social media"
   - Verify: Filtered subset appears
   - Check logs: Action should be "refine"
   - Check: Only stories mentioning "social media" shown

3. Type: "Which one mentions automation?"
   - Verify: Further filtered results
   - Check: Progressive refinement working

### API Test with curl

**Turn 1 - Initial Search:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "find 10 marketing stories",
    "conversation_history": []
  }' | jq '.results.stories | length'

# Expected: 10
```

**Turn 2 - Refinement:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "out of those, which mention omnichannel",
    "conversation_history": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "find 10 marketing stories"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are 10 marketing stories:"}
    ]
  }' | jq '.results.stories | length'

# Expected: <10 (filtered subset)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Refinement Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Follow-up query performs new search instead of filtering
- "Refine action detected but no previous results available"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backend logs for:
INFO: >>> Found X previous results in session context

# If shows 0 or not found:
# - Session key not matching
# - Context not stored from previous turn
```

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure conversation_history is passed in API calls
2. Session key depends on conversation history
3. Check that initial search stored results

### Issue: No Results After Refinement

**Symptoms:**
- Refinement executes but returns 0 results
- Message: "I couldn't find any stories matching that criteria"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check logs:
INFO: >>> Filtered from X to 0 stories
```

**Causes:**
- Filter term doesn't match any stories
- Case-sensitive matching issue (should be case-insensitive)
- Filter term not found in name/body/slug

**Solutions:**
- Try broader filter terms
- Check story content in debug output
- Verify filter logic is working

### Issue: Context Not Persisting

**Symptoms:**
- Each query acts as new search
- Session context not found

**Diagnosis:**
- Session key generation issue
- Context cleared prematurely

**Solution:**
- Implement proper session management
- Use external storage (Redis) for production
- Add session debugging logs

## Best Practices

### For Users

**Do:**
- "Out of those, show me X" ✅
- "From these results, which mention Y" ✅
- "Filter by Z" ✅

**Avoid:**
- Ambiguous references without context
- Mixing topics in one query

### For Developers

**Context Management:**
- Clear context when new unrelated search starts
- Implement session timeouts
- Use Redis for production (not in-memory dict)

**Filter Logic:**
- Make case-insensitive
- Search multiple fields (name, body, slug)
- Consider fuzzy matching for better UX

**Error Handling:**
- Handle empty previous results gracefully
- Inform user when context is lost
- Suggest starting new search if needed

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - Date ranges: "published this year"
   - Author filtering: "by John Smith"
   - Multiple criteria: "about AI and published recently"

2. **Fuzzy Matching:**
   - Handle typos and variations
   - Semantic similarity matching

3. **Result Ranking:**
   - Sort by relevance within filtered results
   - Score matches by field (title vs body)

4. **Session Persistence:**
   - Store in Redis with TTL
   - Cross-device session sync
   - Session history/replay

5. **Context Visualization:**
   - Show users what results are being filtered
   - Breadcrumb of refinement steps
   - "Reset to original results" button

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- In-memory storage: ~1-2KB per story × 10 stories × N sessions
- Recommend: Implement cleanup for old sessions
- Production: Use Redis with TTL

### Response Time
- Refinement: <100ms (in-memory filter)
- New search: 1-3s (API call)
- No additional latency for context-aware features
