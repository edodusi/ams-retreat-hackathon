# Context-Aware Refinement - Fix Summary

## 🐛 Bug Report
**Issue:** Refinement not working - "I don't have access to previous results"
**Your Test Case:** 
1. "find the articles that mention the drupal migration" → Got 10 articles ✅
2. "of those, get 2 articles that mention the CLI" → Error ❌

## 🔍 Root Cause
The session key was changing between requests, causing the system to lose track of previous results.

**Why it broke:**
- Session key = hash(ALL user messages)
- Request 1: hash("find articles...") = `key_ABC`
- Request 2: hash("find articles..." + "of those...") = `key_XYZ`
- Different keys → Can't find stored results

## ✅ Fix Applied
Changed session key generation to use only the FIRST user message.

**Now:**
- Session key = hash(FIRST user message only)
- Request 1: hash("find articles...") = `key_ABC`
- Request 2: hash("find articles...") = `key_ABC` ← Same!
- Same key → Finds stored results ✅

## 📝 Code Change

**File:** `backend/main.py` (lines ~143-152)

**Before:**
```python
user_messages = [msg.content for msg in conversation_history if msg.role == "user"]
session_data = "|".join(user_messages)  # ALL messages
session_key = hashlib.md5(session_data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**After:**
```python
user_messages = [msg.content for msg in conversation_history if msg.role == "user"]
if user_messages:
    session_key = hashlib.md5(user_messages[0].encode()).hexdigest()  # FIRST only
```

## 🧪 How to Test Your Exact Scenario

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/edodusi/Storyblok/ams-retreat-hackathon
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### Step 2: Open Frontend
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/frontend/index.html
```

### Step 3: Test Your Queries
```
1. Type: "find the articles that mention the drupal migration"
   ✅ Should return ~10 articles

2. Type: "of those, get 2 articles that mention the CLI"
   ✅ Should return filtered articles
   ❌ Should NOT say "don't have access to previous results"
```

### Step 4: Check Backend Logs
Look for these lines:
```
# Request 1
INFO: >>> Session key: f56551ec4cd77f8a30718960b67521d5
INFO: >>> Stored 10 stories in session 'f56551ec4cd77f8a30718960b67521d5'

# Request 2
INFO: >>> Session key: f56551ec4cd77f8a30718960b67521d5  ← SAME!
INFO: >>> Found 10 previous results in session context  ← FOUND!
INFO: >>> REFINING PREVIOUS RESULTS with filter: 'CLI'
INFO: >>> Filtered from 10 to X stories
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- [ ] Session key stays the same between requests
- [ ] Backend log shows "Found X previous results"
- [ ] Claude action is "refine" (not "search")
- [ ] Gets filtered results (not new search)
- [ ] NO error message about "no previous results"

### If It Still Fails:
1. Check that conversation_history is being sent from frontend
2. Verify backend logs show the session key
3. Run the automated test: `python3 test_context_fix.py`
4. Check if results were actually stored in first request

## 📊 Automated Test Script

Created: `test_context_fix.py`

```bash
# Run the automated test
python3 test_context_fix.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ Response 1: 10 stories returned
# ✅ Response 2: 2 stories returned
# ✅ REFINEMENT SUCCESSFUL!
```

## 🚀 What This Enables

Now you can:
- ✅ "find 10 marketing stories" → "of those, which mention omnichannel"
- ✅ "find blog posts" → "from these, show AI ones" → "which one about ML"
- ✅ Multiple sequential refinements
- ✅ Natural follow-up questions
